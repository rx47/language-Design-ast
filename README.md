# Language Design AST 🚀

## 🛠️ Build the Project

To build the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Terminal tab in VS Code and open a new Terminal.
3. Once the Terminal has loaded, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet build
```

4. 🎉 The project will be built into an executable. Once the build process is finished, the file path to the executable will be displayed.

##  🏃 Open and Run the Project

To open and run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in Visual Studio Code.
2. Click on the Terminal tab in VS Code and open a new Terminal.
3. Once the Terminal has loaded, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

4. After running the command, you will be presented with two exciting options:

```
🌟 Select an option:
1. Lex file and display results 🎨
2. Parse file and explore the magic ✨
Enter your choice:
```

- If you choose option 1, the tokenizer will create tokens from the provided code, giving you a visual representation of the results. 💡🎨
- If you choose option 2, will get into parsing and dive into the abstract syntax tree (AST) of the code! ✨🌳

## 📝 Changing Test Files

To change the test file used in the program, follow these steps:

1. Open the `Main.cs` file in the project.
2. Locate the fifth line in the file.
3. Within the quotation marks (`""`), you will find the name of the current file (e.g., `"test1.txt"`).
4. Replace the current file name with the desired test file name.

Remember to save the changes after modifying the test file
